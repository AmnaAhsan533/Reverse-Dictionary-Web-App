# 🔍 Reverse Dictionary Web App

This is a simple and responsive Reverse Dictionary web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It lets users find words based on their descriptions by using the **Datamuse API**.

# 🌟 Purpose

The main purpose of this project was to **practically implement my learning of APIs**. After understanding what APIs are and how they work, I wanted to build a hands-on project to reinforce that knowledge and this Reverse Dictionary was the perfect start!

# 🚀 Features

- Search for words based on descriptions or meanings
- Fetches results using the Datamuse API
- Displays only the top 3 most relevant words
- Fully responsive and user-friendly interface
- Clean and modern design

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- **Datamuse API**

# 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a short description (e.g. *"fear of heights", "study of plants"...*).
2. The app sends a request to the Datamuse API using the `ml` (means like) query parameter.
3. The top 3 matching words are displayed as results.
